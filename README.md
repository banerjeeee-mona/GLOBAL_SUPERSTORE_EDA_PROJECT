# GLOBAL_SUPERSTORE_EDA_PROJECT

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of the "Global SuperStore" dataset, aiming to uncover key business insights related to sales, profitability, and customer behavior across different regions and product categories. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify trends, performance bottlenecks, and opportunities for business improvement.

## Key Features & Analysis

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies within the raw dataset.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed detailed statistical analysis and visualizations to understand data distributions, relationships between variables, and initial patterns.
* **Sales and Profitability Analysis:** Examined sales and profit trends over time, by region, country, product category, sub-category, and customer segments.
* **Customer Segmentation Insights:** Explored customer purchasing habits and profitability across different segments.
* **Geographical Performance:** Visualized sales and profit distribution across various countries and regions to identify top-performing and underperforming areas.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilized libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and potentially Plotly (if used) to create compelling and interactive data visualizations.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the **Global SuperStore Dataset**, a publicly available dataset containing sales transactions across various product categories and regions.
